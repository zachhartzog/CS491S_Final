I might just adopt the Astros , @Crazy4NYSports . Fun team to watch. I enjoy how they play baseball. Another impressive win last night.	0	0	
To me, the best team in baseball is the Astros , and no one comes close. They got the pitching and hitting to get it done. Most complete team	0	0	
The Astros remind me of the 06 Tigers. This is a team that can beat you in many ways. They can win long ball, small ball, low-scoring games	0	0
