The disparity in slugging percentage between Frazier and Red Sox 3B is staggering (over 200 points since 6/1). Absolutely worth a shot.	0	2	
I'd rather lose 9-1 (like I saw the Yankees beat the Sox @Stadium in June). These come from ahead 1 run losses are KILLING ME!	0	0

I've wanted Todd Frazier on the Red Sox for years. Power bat and 3B all in one. the .210 avg means nothing. 1.8 WAR is nice.	0	0
