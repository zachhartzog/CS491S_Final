If it does factor in it'll be a push at 5. I envision them getting 5 by the 7th at latest against a tanking Reds team but great value	0	1

The Yankees are making progress on a trade for Sonny Gray and Yonder Alonso, @Feinsand reports. Could propel them to AL East superiority.	7	7	
The ERA thing is pure coincidence. Sanchez also leads the league in passed balls. Love Gary but he's in a big slump, physically and mentally	0	0	
Yu Darvish to the Yankees ! Make it happen	0	0	
Sanchez .344 OBP, 14 HR's. Romine .292 OBP, 2 HR's. Must I go on?	0	0

@SoxFromThe207 This is not good news but yankees are nearing deal to acquire Gray and Alonso from Yankees	0	0	
You are also forgetting the yankees also have starters they can move on top of prospects, headley, betances, etc	0	0

2 days of rest isn't necessary, especially after the a star break. If anything, it could throw him out of rhythm.	0	1

Gray move would make sense for the Yankees given that Pineda/Sabathia are free agents. He's signed through 2019; solid starter for 2+ years.	91	197
